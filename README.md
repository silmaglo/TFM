scripts and data examples of my master's thesis

inside of counting_particles, there are available two python scripts:
- **num_particles.ipynb**: counts the number of each type of particle available (for now: electrons, gammas and alpha particles)
- **plot_particles.ipynb**: plots of some example of particles. the plots show both energy and noise separately. 

inside of preprocessing, there are available two python scripts:
- **crop_images.ipynb**: crops all energy and noise images and moves them to a new directory.

inside of dataset_partition, there is available one python script:
- **creating_directories.ipynb**: slipts date into three dataset (train, validation, test)

inside of electrons_vs_noise, we can find six files:
- **eVSn_1.npz**: contains the electron energy and the noise stored separately
- **preparing_data_eVSn.ipynb**: notebook that prepares the npz file just mentioned from the cropped images
- **electron_vs_noise.ipynb**: notebook where convolutional neural networks are built in order to classify as electron or noise
- **add_noise_to_e.ipynb**: notebook where the noise is added to the energy signal to create a npz file called eVSn_noisy1
- **eVSn_noisy1.npz**: contains the electron energy+noise and the noise stored separately
- **e_noisy_vs_noise.ipynb**: notebook where convolutional neural networks are built in order to classify as electron or noise, but in this case, the image of the electron includes also noise

inside of electrons_vs_muons, we can find eight files:
- **less_data**: folder contaning first round of data. There are two files, one with the training and validation data and the other one left, containig the testing data. The training dataset has been over/undersampled.
- **more_data**: folder contaning first round of data. There are three files, one with the traning, another with validation data and the last one, containig the testing data. The training dataset has been over/undersampled. The training dataset has been over/undersampled.

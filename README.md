scripts and data examples of my master's thesis

inside of counting_particles, there are available two python scripts:
- **num_particles.ipynb**: counts the number of each type of particle available (for now: electrons, gammas and alpha particles)
- **plot_particles.ipynb**: plots of some example of particles. the plots show both energy and noise separately. 

inside of counting_particles, there are available two python scripts:
- **crop_images.ipynb**: crops all energy images and moves them to a new directory.
- **dividing_particles.ipynb**: creates a directory for each type of particle and fills them with the data corresponding to each type of particle
